#PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS
##
#It immediately becomes clear that passing is inherently far more important than rushing.
#When one examines the best passing EPA seasons versus rushing, passing is nearly four times more valuable.
#That same data trend of passers adding more value than rushers continues throughout. 
#Tomorrow I will do some box plots to elaborate on this significance of passing doing more than rushing.

#Less important
#In addition, it looks like a few variables are the biggest determinants of epa.
#SIGNIFICANT VARIABLES = YPC, Passing Yards, Pass TDs, Comp %. Maybe more but those are the big ones.
#However, those are all fairly obviously valuable so I am not sure what to do with them.
